<h2>Well done</h2>

<p>Now play the memory task with the Monty Hall Game.  In this study, you will play the Monty Hall Game {% if display_trial_limit > 1 %} {{ display_trial_limit }} times.{% else %} once.{% endif %}</p>
<p>Before the Month Hall Game, there will be a dot memory task, that you have just practiced.</p>
<p>In this game, Monty Hall, a thoroughly honest game-show host, has placed the car behind one of three doors.</p>  
<p>There is a goat behind each of the other two doors.</p>
	
<p>First, Monty will ask you to pick a door.  Then he will open one of the other two doors, that you did not pick, to reveal one of the goats</p>
<p>Then, Monty will ask you to make a final choice between the remaining doors.  You can stick with your initial door or switch to the other one.</p>

</div>

<div id="text_with_image">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-8">

<p>You will win whatever is behind the door you finally select.</p>

<p>The aim is winning the car.</p>
	
<p>Remember:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The car and goats are randomly placed behind the doors.</li>
	<li>The unbiased host, Monty, knows where the car and goats are.</li>
	<li>Monty does not re-shuffle the car's location once you begin playing each game.</li>
	<li>Monty never opens your inital choice or reveals the car.</li>
	<li>Monty always reveals one of the goats.</li>
	<li>Monty always offers switch/stick options to the guests.</li>
	
</ul>
